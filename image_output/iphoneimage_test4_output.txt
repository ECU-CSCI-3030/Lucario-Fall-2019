FROM: CADET MAJOR LOGISTICS READMESS SQUADRON COMMANDEI
AFROTC, Detachment 600
306 Wright Annex
Greenville NC, 27858—4353
SUBJECT: Seymour Johnson Base Visit Continuity
l. The purpose of the memorandum is to present continuity for the Seymour Johnson Air Fem
Base (SJAFB) visit.
2. The ?rst objective when planning a base visit should be to ping the detachment for interest in
such an event Cadet Sweger and I have found that it is easier to have cadets ?ll out a paper
interest fonn rather than utilizing a survey in the ups. The form should have three separate
columns: the cadets’ name, the AFSC(s) they are interested in seeing, and their banner ID.
Ensure that this form has numbered rows, in order to streamline the process ofcouming
interested cadets.
3. Once an interest sheet has been prepared, the second objective is to establish positive contact
with the point of contact at SJAFB. As of 15 October 2019, In Shelby M. Chapman is the
public affairs of?cer within the 4‘“ ?ghter wing. However, the recommended COA is to access
the SJAFB website, ?ll out the form noted as attachment 1 in this memorandum, and send it to
4FW.PA.CivicOutreach@us.a£mil. It is important to note that SJAFB asks for 20 people at
minimum and 40 at mwdmum for pn‘vate toursi Additionally, the requester must provide 60 days
notice for a tour request.
4, A Local/Regional Professional Development Training Request Form is the next
recommended step in the base visit process. A sample of this form has been provided as
attachment 2 in this memorandum as well as a blank copy under attachment 3, As noted in‘
attachment 2, there are a signi?cant number of details that need to be ?lled out. These details are
tentative but should provide a rough outline of how the base visit will be organized as well as
how a PDT credit is being achieved. Furthermore, when ?lling out this form, one should
consider if transportation will be provided through AFROTC or not. When requiestmg such, theIe
are different suspenses to be accounted fort These suspense: are explained wnlun attachment 4,
section 6. l .2 Approval Requirements.
5. There we multiple options to consider when choosing transponation to/from SJAFB. If
provided enough time, the cadet leading the base visit could contact SJAFI} and ask for
transportation. Other options include transportation through the Local/Reglon PDT request form,
the College of Health and Human Performance (HHP), and coordination between cadets
